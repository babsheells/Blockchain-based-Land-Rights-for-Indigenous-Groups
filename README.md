# 🌍 Blockchain-based Land Rights for Indigenous Groups

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform designed to empower indigenous communities by securing their ancestral land rights on the blockchain! Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, this project addresses real-world challenges like land disputes, lack of formal documentation, and external encroachments. It provides immutable, transparent records of land ownership, community governance, and dispute resolution, helping indigenous groups maintain control over their territories without relying on centralized authorities.

## ✨ Features

🌐 Register and map indigenous land parcels with geospatial data  
🔒 Issue NFTs as proof of communal or individual ownership  
🗳️ Community voting for land use decisions and amendments  
⚖️ Built-in dispute resolution with escrow and arbitration  
💰 Fund management for community resources derived from land (e.g., eco-tourism royalties)  
📜 Immutable audit trails for all transactions and changes  
✅ Third-party verification of land claims  
🚫 Prevention of fraudulent claims through multi-signature approvals  
🤝 Integration with off-chain legal frameworks for enforceability  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized ecosystem for land rights management. Here's a high-level overview of the contracts and their roles:

1. **LandRegistryContract**: Handles the registration of land parcels, storing details like boundaries (using hashed geospatial data), community identifiers, and initial claims. Prevents duplicates by checking existing hashes.  
2. **OwnershipNFTContract**: Mints and manages NFTs representing ownership shares or rights to specific land parcels. Supports fractional ownership for communal lands.  
3. **CommunityGovernanceContract**: Enables token-based voting for decisions like land use policies, transfers, or amendments. Uses multi-signature thresholds for indigenous group approvals.  
4. **DisputeResolutionContract**: Manages disputes by locking disputed assets in escrow, allowing arbitration votes from community members or trusted oracles, and resolving with automated payouts.  
5. **FundManagementContract**: Tracks and distributes funds from land-related activities (e.g., leasing or grants). Includes royalty splits and transparent withdrawals.  
6. **VerificationContract**: Provides public functions to query and verify land details, ownership proofs, and historical changes without revealing sensitive data.  
7. **AuditTrailContract**: Logs all events across the system immutably, creating a tamper-proof history for audits or legal purposes.  
8. **AccessControlContract**: Manages permissions, roles (e.g., community admins, verifiers), and multi-sig requirements to ensure only authorized parties can interact with the system.

**For Indigenous Communities**  
- Map your land: Generate a hash of geospatial data (e.g., via GIS tools) and call `register-land-parcel` in LandRegistryContract with boundaries, community ID, and supporting docs.  
- Claim ownership: Mint NFTs via OwnershipNFTContract to represent rights.  
- Govern collectively: Use CommunityGovernanceContract to propose and vote on changes—e.g., "Should we lease this area for sustainable farming?"  
- Handle funds: Deposit royalties into FundManagementContract and withdraw via approved votes.  

Boom! Your land rights are now securely documented and enforceable on the blockchain.

**For Verifiers or Authorities**  
- Check claims: Call `verify-land-ownership` in VerificationContract with a parcel ID to get immutable proof.  
- Review history: Query AuditTrailContract for a full timeline of actions.  
- Resolve issues: If a dispute arises, interact with DisputeResolutionContract to submit evidence and participate in arbitration.

**For External Parties (e.g., Governments or NGOs)**  
- Integrate: Use AccessControlContract to gain read-only access for validation.  
- Collaborate: Propose partnerships through governance votes, ensuring community consent.

This setup solves the real-world problem of insecure land tenure for indigenous groups by decentralizing control, reducing corruption risks, and providing global verifiability—all powered by Clarity's secure, Bitcoin-anchored smart contracts.
